# 100-Mile-Radius

A web app displaying a map for people to indicate their position by touching a point in the map using a mobile device. 
The app will log the location of the device, the location selected in the map, the time the location was logged.
A server will also log the total of people that have logged themselves in the app, along with the data mentioned above.

Based on the data collected, a visual artwork will be generated by mapping the data to graphics parameters (TBC by the artist). So far, one parameter that has been tentatively defined is mapping location data to a series of multi-colored concentric rings.

The final piece of artwork will be generated after a pre-defined timeframe (TBC by the artist).

Only people within a 100 mile radius of Cromford Mills will be able to access the app and only during the permitted timeframe.
